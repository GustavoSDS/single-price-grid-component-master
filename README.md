## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See a hover state on desktop for the Sign Up call-to-action

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

In the course of the project I learned a better use of html5 tags, use of display flex for greater control of my web pages.
In addition to learning the importance of the mobile firsts methodology. Which allows us to give higher priority to mobile devices, 
which are the ones that are used the most on a day-to-day basis.
For desktop development I learned to use media queries.

### Continued development

So far I am not completely familiar with flex displays, so I would like to continue learning more about it in future projects. As well as the use of media queries.
